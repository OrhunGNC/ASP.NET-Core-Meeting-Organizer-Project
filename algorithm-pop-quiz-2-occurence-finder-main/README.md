## Occurence Finder

Problem:
t and z are strings consist of lowercase English letters.

Find all substrings for t, and return the maximum value of [ len(substring) x [how many times the substring occurs in z] ]

Example:  
t = acldm1labcdhsnd  
z = shabcdacasklksjabcdfueuabcdfhsndsabcdmdabcdfa

Solution:  
abcd is a substring of t, and it occurs 5 times in Z, abcd.Length x 5 = 20 is the solution
